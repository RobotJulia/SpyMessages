# SpyMessages
An homage to Clue: Secrets and Spies

by RobotJulia

This game companion app is to emulate the *discontinued* SMS service that goes with the board game **Clue: Secrets and Spies**. I spent time researching what the messages would have been capable of saying and stuck to the original game designers specs as far as game messages are concerned. This app along with the simple browser app were part of a weekend of .NET that I committed to. 
This application is **game ready** for use with the board game Clue: Secrets and Spies.

~Enjoy
